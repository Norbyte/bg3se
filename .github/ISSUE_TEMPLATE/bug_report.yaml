      # Before you create an issue...

      Note that issues should be created **ONLY** for Script Extender-specific bugs and issues.
      If you are having trouble with a **specific mod**, please report the issue to that mod's
      author, not here.
      
      For a list of common issues and fixes, see the [Troubleshooting Guide]

      After you have attempted common fixes, please search using the search bar on the [Issues] page
      to see if an issue already exists for the bug you encountered. If there is, please add to
      that issue instead of making a new one. You can also react with üëç to prioritize an issue.
      
      Only AFTER you have attempted common fixes and looked for an existing issue should you go
      ahead and create a new issue.
